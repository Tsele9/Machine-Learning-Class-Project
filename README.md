In the actual world, we are surrounded by individuals who can learn anything from their experiences thanks to their learning abilities, and we have computers or robots that follow our commands. Can a machine, like a person, learn from prior experiences or data? This is where Machine Learning comes in. Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the development of algorithms that allow a machine to learn on its own from data and previous experiences. In order to create predictive models, machine learning combines computer science and statistics. Machine learning is the process of creating or employing algorithms that learn from past data. The performance will improve as we supply more information. So, in this lab report, we'll use the data supplied by Bank to create a model based on logistic regression. 

The steps in this project report start from data cleaning to model testing using logistic regression.

## Intent of the Projct

The intent of this project is to help student to easy understand what is machine learning by allowing them to 
explore into the world of machine learning in this project we have learned so much from scretch especially python language
we were able to learn how various libraries of python work thanks to Mr Liphoto.

# steps in creating the model
### uploading dataset to jupyter
### dealing with missing values
### dealing with outliers
### descriptive analysis of dataset
### feature extraction
### feature tuning
### model selection
### model training
### model tuning
### pridiction dashboard
